Revision history for Net::SFTP

0.02  2001.05.14
    - Fixed bug with SSH2 server not sending one message per
      packet, ie. multiple packets have to be retrieved to make
      up one SFTP message. This would show up as a "Message length
      too long" error. Thanks to Matt Good for the spot.
    - Fixed bug with OpenSSH and SSH2 SFTP servers where after
      a certain amount of bytes the connection would hang. This
      was a bug in Net::SSH::Perl (channel window sizes) that is
      fixed in version 1.13.
